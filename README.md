# GALENA

This repository contains the proof-of-concept code that implements GALENA (mana**G**ement of **A**daptive authentication based on po**L**ici**E**s a**N**d soci**A**l trust) in NS-3.
GALENA is as an adaptive authentication management system in IoT networks, based on social trust strategies, devicesâ€™ context, and policies.

The academic paper that describes GALENA has been accepted to the [XL Brazilian Simposium of Computer Networking](https://sbrc2022.sbc.org.br/) and has been further explored in the Author's M.Sc. thesis.
